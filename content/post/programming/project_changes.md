if anyone has been looking at my github account 
may have  noticed that I removed/changed some of my projects from github.  I decided to move the code from git to fossil.
fossil is the newest system I use to manage my version control needs.
you may have also noticed I have been changing my license files  to unlicense.
<!--more-->

I found that I really dont have a good reason to claim copyright on my code. 
so I decided making my code have any restrictions on the person using the code is really just a waste of my time because 
I have better things to do with my life. for example write more software! 
so enjoy using my new public domain projects. and yes technically I can call them mine
but because I built them. on the other hand the public now owns them.


the reason for the change from git to fossil is simple. with fossil i feel like i have better control over the vcs
as well as I control issue managemet. and since nobody else uses them I decided well 
there no reason not to swap to my preffered my version control system.

since the projects arent on the github page there will be a new project page on my website listing projects.
