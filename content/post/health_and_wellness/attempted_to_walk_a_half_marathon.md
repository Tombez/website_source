today, I attempted to do a half marathon by myself. I gonna be honest, 
13 miles feels a lot longer than it seems in your head. 
when you compare that to doing your 3 mile walk everyday it doesn't seem so bad.
yeah, but I realized, If I walked I was gonna spend far more time than I actually wanted 
to do this. 

I did not complete a full 13 miles, I did complete 10 miles by myself. 
It took me three hours to complete. not a great time but that only means I can improve. 
the reason, I decided to give up at 10 miles was due to lack of preparation in taking a break 
in the middle, drank a limited water, didn't prepare food before hand. I think the biggest improvement 
I could make was have a better breathing technique, it would help me keep my pace for longer distances.

when I first started, it seemed to go well, started with a good pace, however, 
I end up getting this pain in my right side that I am not sure what it is from. 
that kept from keeping up the pace. is this what runners describe as [a side stitch][1]?
if I could avoid getting that, I would have a farther better time!

i ran up a couple large hills to make it an intense exercise. 

this run was eye opening experience in how to improve my runs!
I will have another post next week about 6 mile run and see what my time is!
