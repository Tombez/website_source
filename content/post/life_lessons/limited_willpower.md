You have limited will power and limited time every single day. However, I believe everyone can change the environment to make good everyday habits easier and bad habits harder to follow thru. 


This idea is about maximizing your willpower each day.
To form good habits, try to make a particular task as easy as possible.  You don't want to give yourself any reason not to do it. If you're going to exercise every day,
You don't make your goal go to the gym every day for three hours. 
Just start by doing a single push-up and maybe a single sit-up. 
You ramp it up little by little as it gets easier, so your continually pushing yourself.


To break a bad habit, make doing that particular bad thing harder to do. 
 Examples of that are set say a timer on your phone of when you should be going to bed, Blocking those distracting websites if you do not want to spend as much time on them.
