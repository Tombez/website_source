recently, I have been making small quality of life updates to the website that should improve how is easy to navigate instead of my usual content. 


<!--more-->
the biggest changes are a new search feature. you can [search](/search/) now which should making find a particular blog post a little easier than tag or 
looking through the post list.  the search feature was pulled from [this great tutorial](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/dynamic-search-in-a-static-hugo-website/) at developer for life. 
It has some kinks to work out but it does work. 

the other feature was  a [404 page](/404/) which i should have setup a while ago just haven't gotten to it yet. 
It basically tells you the page you were looking for doesn't or no longer exists on the website rather than  a completely blank screen. 

there was some other backend stuff like a [content security policy](https://blog.jeremylikness.com/blog/create-content-security-policy-csp-in-hugo/). managing some security with that. 
and making new content easier to put in with 
[archetypes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/archetypes/).  the archetypes  manage some of large website template stuff.

I got the social media icons working too. which means they aren't just a blob.
