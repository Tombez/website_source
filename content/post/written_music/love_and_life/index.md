so i was feeling sad about a rejection and it got me playing my piano but the more played. 
I felt this desire to create a song.  hoping you guys who do read this like it.

* the midi version: [love_and_life.midi](./love_and_life.midi)
* the mp3 version: [love_and_life.mp3](./love_and_life.mp3)

the mp3 is made with some really cheap software so it doesnt quite sound right. 
one day i will fix that.
