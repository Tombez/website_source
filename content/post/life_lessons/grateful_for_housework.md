Housework is the bane of modern existence.
I have increasingly learned in many cases, that I should be grateful that I have even a house to work in. also
dishes to clean, laundry to wash, and carpet to vacuum.   Instead of thinking, "ugh, I hate laundry. Why do you exist?".
think "I hate cleaning laundry, but you do help me out in so many ways thank you for that."
you think I am going to appreciate my laundry by cleaning it.  

Every single time I go to work, I don't think ugh another day at work. I think yes, 
I get to help people out today. Yes, I do this for goals in my life.  
Yes, because of this job, I can sometimes eat excellent tasting food!!. 

I believe this sort of positive mentality about my work helps me get more done in my job than other attitudes.
By focusing, what you are grateful for, It creates a desire to find ways to appreciate the things you have more often. 
Thus always be grateful, and you never know it might turn out that it gets more things that you thought.
