My reasoning is two-fold. Time and money. Going to the gym costs money.  
Money that i could save up for a car, a house, a world trip. And it costs me time to get there and get settled into the gym to start my exercising as well as the time to get back to the house. repeat that once doesn't seem like a big deal. 
but over time it adds up. 
I generally use in-home exercises instead. they might not get me the best possible results compared to the gym but they are definitely a lot more effective than doing nothing at all. 
for example, my regular workout consists of a three-mile run, at least 20 push-ups and 20 sit-ups.  every couple of days I mix it up. 
adding some planks, squats, jumping jacks, etc. the goal is to keep moving and pushing myself even though i don't go to the gym or follow an already established workout routine.
