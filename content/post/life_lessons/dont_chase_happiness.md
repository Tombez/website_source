If I have learned one thing in my short life, it is this simple lesson; don't chase happiness. Let it come to you. 

Those chase happiness are those who are most miserable. Why? Simply because you can't chase happiness.
You are chasing success or material wealth or some out there knowledge. 
That degree, girlfriend, fancy truck, big house, or pie won't make you happy. 
They will only give you a diminishing sense  of joy.
 Chase the next most valuable, most expensive thing.
 
 Those who chase material stuff will find their happiness to be short-lived.
 It ends up feeling like a blip in their life. 

It would help if you learned to accept the bad, sad, terrible, most unhappy times to appreciate the happiest moments.
You will find happy moments in the otherwise most mundane of things when you stop looking for happiness.
You will discover ways to improve people's lives when you are feeling seemingly powerless if you don't chase the "big" improvements.

If you want to be happier, don't chase eternal bliss or assume things will automatically make you more joyful, but slow down appreciate the little things in life. 
That's how you be happy.
