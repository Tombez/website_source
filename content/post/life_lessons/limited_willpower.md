You have limited will power and limited time every single day. However, I believe everyone has the ability to change the environment to make everyday good habits easier and bad habits harder to follow thru. 


This idea is about maximizing your willpower each day.  you use a limited amount on the bad things, only as much as needed to get the good things going. 

To form good habits try to make the particular task as easy as possible. You give yourself no reason not to do it. if you want to exercise every day. 
you don't make your goal go to the gym every day for three hours. 
just start by doing a single push up and maybe a single situp. 
you ramp it up little by little as it gets easier so your constantly pushing yourself.


To break a bad habit make doing that particular bad thing harder to do. 
 Examples of that are set say a timer on your phone of when you should be going to bed. blocking those distracting websites if you do not want to spend as much time on them.
