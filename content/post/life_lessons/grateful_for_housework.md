housework the bane of modern existence.
It is one thing you should learn to be grateful for because you could not have dishes to wash at all. You could be forced to eat out of garbage can. you could have no vacuum for vacuuming up your house.

Next you do housework think about how much worse it could be if you didn't have the stuff to do housework on.
