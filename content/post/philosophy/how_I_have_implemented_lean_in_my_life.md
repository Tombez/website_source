one of my classes is all about explaining lean. my teacher explains the concepts behind 
lean but doesnt seem to have an Idea of showing us how to implement them.I decided lets try implementing some of these basic principles 
at home.
<!--more--!>

the very first thing I did was to implement lean was start by cleaning my desk drawer.
it was a mess. I 3s th drawer. the three s's being sweep,sort,standardized it.
I every day started with another part of the room until I found that I cleaned the entire 
room. well almost the entire room. I started a procedure for all the steps that it takes me to get up in the morning.

then I started using a stop watch to time to figure out how longs it takes for me to get something done.
I would try to find a way to beat my last time doing something. its became a race to see how fast I can get work done
with making a mess.

I have begin realizing just how inefficent I do every day things. it used to take a solid 20 minutes to get up in the
morning. now it takes only 10 minutes. I have exact procedure so I dont even think about what I am doing.
I can spend my brain power now on what I have to do that day.

to help make sure I am continously improving, I have started doing reflections on what I do every 4 days. 
I count how many things that I got done in those 4 days. and make sure I got at least 4 2 second improvements every day.

I recommend you start doing something like this. when you try implementing only do a piece a day. only do sections of
your life at time.  do try do it all at once. soon you will become demotivated to do it.
