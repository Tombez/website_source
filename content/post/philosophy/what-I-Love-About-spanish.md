learning a second language is definitely  a hard task to do. 
The more  I learn Spanish, the more I feel like it makes me question why things are the way they are in English. 
<!-- more -->


one of two biggest differences which are rather interesting to think about  is order of words in a language. 
and the other is gendering of words and things. 
for example, you don't say prefect family in Spanish. you say "familia prefecta". 
the order of adjectives are swapped from English. 
its strange but rather interesting to think about when it comes to how languages work. 


however my favorite thing  about Spanish so far is the single word for pairs of gendered words. 
for example there is one word for sibling in Spanish.  "hermano" or "hermana"  for 
brother or sister. or similarly "abuela" or "abuelo"
or for example "nino" or "nina" involving children. 

the most interesting part however is how English and Spanish questions are written. 
"do you" has no direct translation. it changes based on context. 
Spanish doesn't have a word similar to it.  the closest would the English equivalent to this or "esta", "este" or "estos"

learning Spanish to me is rather interesting when I compare it to the process of learning a programming language. 
there are usually a lot of different ways to write or communicate. 
however, I would say swapping between programming languages are easier unless you go off to more exotic languages like the difference between 
pure functional and imperative  programming languages.
