One of my economic teachers has taught me one great lesson nothing comes for "free."
There is no such thing as a free lunch. When you think about the cost of things, you will realize that most items come with a time cost. Or an opportunity or some require a social fee. Most prices can be categorized into three primary parts time, money, effort. 
For example, you could paint your own house rather than have someone else do it. You save money that way but lose in time. You can buy a bicycle and use that instead of walk. Save in time but spend a little bit of effort to fix it or storing it. 

When you ever make a decision, don't just think of the monetary cost of it, but the time, effort, or other resources you spend on such items. Even though everything comes with a price doesn't mean you should stop doing things. 
I think that the vast majority of actions people take every day are almost always worth it in the end.
