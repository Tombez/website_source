I use my phone and computer in a lot of aspects. Everything from gaming, writing, music, drawing,  to my work. However, I Don't think its good to sit on your phone or computer all day every day. there are three tools that I use can help you reign in your usage of your phone and computer time that I will highly recommend anyone. 

The first of the tools is for your phone I recommend to you is the app [screen time][1]. It gives you an idea of how much time you spend on your phone and breaks it down by app.  Screen Time can block by categories and individually. 
With this app, you might find yourself cutting a  lot of time just randomly scrolling and spend It on something you care about more.
for me, I didn't realize I spend over 4 hours every day on my phone. 
screen time help me reduce that time down to 2 hours. 

the next tool is for your browser called [leech block][2]. Its a browser extension that blocks certain websites. one of my favorite features of this tool is how not only can you set a certain time limit but also a certain schedule.
for example, I set this up to block all websites at night time so it tells me to go to bed rather than the spend the night awake.  Its really easy to get hooked to a show 
and not realize that it is 3 in the morning.  those two features can be even combined so that say on weekend watch whatever you want but during the week you spend them doing chores. 

third tool is similar to leech block but for phone. I have tried to get leech block to work on the chrome browser on my phone however, 
I found that the best alternative to be [block site][3].  block site can you keep concentrated at work. It keeps you away from game websites and other inappropriate sites.
