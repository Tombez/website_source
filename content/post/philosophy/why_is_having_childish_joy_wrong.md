There was something one of my coworkers said that was bothering met.
That I was such child, the thing that bothered me is that I don't consider myself quite a child but not quite a relatively independent adult. 

It almost offended me. However, upon thinking about it, i was having fun dressed up as a turkey to get money for a 
charity to feed local families. 

Yeah, was that childish? Sure, by most people's standards, I would be considered to be acting childlike, but I don't think that matters all that much to me.
The money goes to a good cause, and If I have to look ridiculous to help people, I don't care. 
I would rather help people then be so worried about what I look like. 

That childish joy should be in everyone; I see so many "adults" that I think could use some of that childlike joy in them. To be grateful for the little things, even the ridiculous things. Like dressing up in an embarrassing turkey costume.
