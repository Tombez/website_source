right now, I would like to start a career in software development however. finding work that doesnt require a bachelors degree 
is kinda of hard.  not to say that i am against learning more stuff. but i generally believe if your not learning while programming.
then you really arent programming at all.

<!--more-->
this leads to the point of this post. I am hoping to start making games people are willing to pay for.
while being able to take on any projects that someone could want to be done. 

with this i will start my patreon at [patreon.com/5hammer].
