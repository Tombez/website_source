I believe that the Internet is an invaluable tool when it comes to learning new things, with modern computers becoming extremely inexpensive. While access to wi-fi is becoming a regular occurrence, online learning has changed how someone can learn something dramatically.
You can learn a good chunk of language with a single app on your phone, spending maybe 100 dollars for a year of learning.

Compare that cost to the traditional college course. Three semesters at a community college would still cost me around 3000 dollars. 
There are still advantages to traditional college classrooms like focus more consistent and frequent review.
More complex feedback. 

However, while learning with duo-lingo and Simply Piano, they have at least two advantages over traditional. 
Online apps can work with inconsistent schedules, and they can make learning feel more like a game. 
When you're having fun, you tend to be more successful at things you want to accomplish!

I will start with Simply Piano. If i wanted to learn via music teacher, I would have to have weird schedules every week due to working a retail job. 
however, with an app, I can get my piano practice whenever I have a free moment.

this same concept applies to duolingo. I can practice and expand my vocabulary and grammar skills in a foreign language without 
necessarily needing another human to constantly be helping me out all the time.

online classes/programs greatly improve the ease at which someone can learn something so  dont immediately discount those tools
