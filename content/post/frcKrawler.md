so lately I have been posting on my website for a while that was due to having to work for skynet robotics team.
our team was having some difficulty using the frcKrawler app. so I have decided as a summer project. I was going
to work on the export functionality of the app.
<!--more-->
one of the problems our team has had is the ability to export to excel correctly. the data would come out all in
a single cell. one of the other problems at least I have is the code is terribly undocumented. as well as their
being lots of extra completely uneccessary files in the project.
the structure just isnt very straight forward
so instead of just complaining about it I am going to dedicate myself this summer to make the project cleaner and
far more documented.
