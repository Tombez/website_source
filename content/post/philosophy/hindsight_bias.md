What is hind-sight bias? Why would someone care?
We humans have incredible predictive power in our brains. But it comes with one rather interesting flaw,
hind-sight. 

See when we make mistakes, we can analyze what was something we did want and things we didn't. 
We ask ourselves, how can the information from the past experience be applied to the future. 
We ask ourselves if our decisions generated good or generated bad. 
See when determing that info. There is one problem. Usually we assume, had the information that could have only been 
learned after  making the decision.

This analysis goes awry, when the assumption is made. For example, you buy a ticket at a lottery.
And you win! Yippee! Now, knowing that information, you might buy another lottery ticket, with the assumption,
that it will turn out the exact same way as the first with a win.  Turns out you were wrong you lost. 
And you beat yourself up over it. 

See, heres the problem, you dont need to beat yourself up over a bad decision. In many, cases a decision cant be reversed. 
It cant be changed. you cant know if a girl will like you, if you dont ask. you cant win the lottery if you dont buy a ticket. 
you cant be rich with dealing with risk. otherwise your one of the millions who use the tried and true method and ends up medicore 
like everyone else. 

am I writing this to inspire you? To make you aware? or simple entertain you? I honestly dont know, 
maybe this information will be useful maybe not?
