if you have read my many other websites, you will know that are many generations that have come 
before this one. this post is a reminder to myself to keep writing, to keep with the struggle. 
this post serves a second purpose as a promise to any future readers that I will keep up with this 
website unlike the rest of the time that I have. 


this is to remind myself the struggles and failures are necessary to push forward with new knowledge I now have. 
I will put more time and effort into this then I have before.
