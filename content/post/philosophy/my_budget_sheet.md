I believe everyone should have a budget. what do I mean when I say budget?
A record of how much money is going in and out of each of your account. 
Hard numbers for your expenses make it easier to figure what to cut out when your trying to save money. 
A perfect tool for that is A spreadsheet.

<!--more-->
 
this post is supposed to give someone a starting point on a budgeting system.
the office software I am using to build my budget sheet is [libreOffice], specifically libreOffice Calc. 
A completely free office software suit that I would recommend to anyone looking for office software.
this software is also [libre] which means you can  run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software without 
nearly any limitations.

now that, we have our software we are going to use, lets build I think the most important part of 
the budget sheet, figuring exactly how much money is coming in.
in my particular case of working retail, my hours do vary sometimes by a lot from one week to next. 
to figure out how much I would expect to make in a week I build table. I put in how much I make in an hour in the top. 
so If I were to one day to make a pay raise all these numbers would auto Adjust.
