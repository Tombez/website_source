I used to ask myself a long time ago what i wanted every day.
I found that even getting that one thing i wanted was never quite satisfying enough. I have learned instead to count the things i am grateful for every day.

I have less time to complain if most of my time is appreciating what I already have. If i do have something i won't do it's not just cause it's, annoying me. I consider it in scope things I have.
