I believe everyone should have a budget. What do I mean when I say budget?
A record of how much money is going in and out of each of your accounts. 
Hard numbers for your expenses make it easier to figure what to cut out when you're trying to save money. 
A perfect tool for that is A spreadsheet.

This post is supposed to give someone a starting point on a budgeting system.
The office software I am using to build my budget sheet is [libreOffice], specifically LibreOffice Calc. 
A completely free office software suite that I would recommend to anyone looking for office software.
This software is also [libre] which means you can  run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software without 
nearly any limitations.

Now that, we have our software we are going to use, let's build I think the most important part of 
the budget sheet, figuring exactly how much money is coming in.
In my particular case of working retail, my hours do sometimes vary by a lot from one week to next. 
To figure out how much I would expect to make in a week, I build a table. I put in how much I make in an hour at the top. 
So If I were to one day to get a pay raise, all of the calculated numbers that depend on pay would auto-Adjust to meet the new value.

Then there is a tax rate below to account for how much I would actually make. 
Below there are two sorts of tables, one with hours and pay for that week and finally pay for that week after taxes. 
It gives you a rough idea of how much money you make at the end of a shift. 

The second set of tables on the right side are similar to the ones on the left. However, they focus on the Three most important average hours per week. 
Weeks, month, years are the columns. The rows are gross income, after taxes, after expenses. 
So let's say I wanted to save a lot of money for a big purchase, it would tell me how much I could save by the end of the year if I followed one of the tables. 

<!-- {{< figure src="images/balance_sheet.png" title="first view" height="300px" link="budget_sheet.ods" >}} -->

On the left side is a table of expenses, this table breaks down each reoccurring expense by how much it would cost me a week, month, year. i put in actual value with what frequency I pay. And the other cells are filled with a formula that calculates for me other columns. 
This gives me an idea of how much I am spending each week on certain things. If some subscription is actually really expensive rather than cheap when taken to long time scales or the other way around. 
At the bottom are the totals so that I can compare the expenses to income ratio. So I know If I end up paying for more than I am actually making. 
This info can be put into other formulas to allow me to check if my finances are on track for my goals. 

My budget sheet contains two more sheets. One I call large one-time purchases, these are things you might want to buy, but it might take a while to save up your money for. 
And the other contains a formula that results try to predict based on the balance sheet before how much money to make. 

[this spreadsheet] and the [libreOffice] software has helped me determine my finances and goals far easier than if I were to do all of these calculations by hand. 
Thanks for your time reading my article!
