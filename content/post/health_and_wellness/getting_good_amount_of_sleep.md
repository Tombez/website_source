Like everyone else, I would like to get the right amount of sleep every day. 
Sleep has a huge number of health benefits, so why not get the proper amount?
You spend nearly a third of your life sleeping so making a good experience every-time should be a goal everyone has in their life. 

I use three helpful tips to make sleep an enjoyable experience every night.  
The first one is to go to sleep fast is always going to bed at the nearly same time every day.
 The next is to try to get up at nearly the same time. I usually go to bed at midnight and get up at 8:30amish.
Sometimes 30minutes earlier or thirty minutes later, depending on how I am feeling.

To help to make sure I go to bed at the same time, I rely on a browser add-on named [leech block](https://www.proginosko.com/leechblock/) 
That denies me access to the Internet at midnight the usual time I go to bed. leech-block must be programmed for the time you want to block access for you. Read the help for how to configure the add-on. 

 The second tip is  I highly recommend getting a sleep mask. Sleep masks are a cheap way to help you fall asleep. 
 You can find one at Walmart near you for less than 3 dollars.  
 Sleep masks have two benefits, one obvious, the other not so much. The first benefit is keeping light out of your eyes, and the second is keeping part of your face warm. 
It can help keep you asleep in cases you aren't in an environment with the most optimal light setting for sleep.
The second seems a strange benefit to mention, but if you like being comfortably warm when sleeping like me, then you will enjoy the insulation.


the third trick is that even when you can't fall asleep is to not worry about it.
If I am not sleeping well, I get up and do something, maybe as simple as cleaning something or read a book. 
Make sure whatever you choose to do, you don't take a considerable amount of physical or mental effort as to force to be a certain amount of awake.   
By getting up, you don't get anxious; doing extra work will naturally make you more tired, thus fall asleep.
 As a by-product,  you get a cleaner house. 

The three tips, consistent time for sleep, sleep mask, getting up when your anxious rather than sitting in bed, will help you enjoy waking up every day with energy. You will find yourself looking forward to falling asleep more often.
