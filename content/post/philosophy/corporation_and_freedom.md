I am a developer of software ateheart but after reading blog about qt and freedom.
something kept bothering me. 
I am totally for free software and open source code. it seems to me that
some people havle this idea of corporation == evil and lack of freedom;
people keep forgetting that corporations are made of people. 
gnu is n on profit that has a single intent which is give the power back 
to the oridinary developer.

ddsome corporate leaders  have decided to give a little power back to the ordinary developer.
which doesnt drive innovation in fact all it does is drive innovators away
from their platform.
which in turn makes their product less in its potential.

not so great products make for  really average profits. 
when developers and users have the freedom to make a product the best it can be. 
users tend to make thproduct better. with this better product, users will try to make 
money. corporations can use this new innovation to improve their product.
better product means more money!
