a year or two, ago I was one of the many people  who had only used  microsoft windows 
their entire lives.  I never even heard of something like linux. nor did I even know what the community was about.
at the time I never really considered other operating systems. like others who use microsoft windows
I was skeptical of system that was built using &quot;free&quot; software. well until I actually used  
linux.

<!--more-->

the start of my linux operating system adventure was when I  got a desktop for volunteering at free geek
(by the way you should volunteer there and help keep old but still useful computers from going to 
trash) 
the desktop came with linux mint installed.
it ran pretty fast considering that less than half the memory and cpu of
a modern laptop. for basic operation of the computer  never even had to think 
about complex commands to run in the terminal.
bas ic operation being running a browser or a couple of games, some basic image editing
as well as editing fancy documents.
 
installing almost all software on the systems
is easy as clicking a couple of buttons like how
msi files work instead the used a software package system
 
the interface was actually quite similar to that of windows 7.
given this going out and buying a new operating system thati cost $250 seemed wasteful and well simply not worth cost.

but this isnt what really drove me to use linux or at least linux based
desktop operating systems
<!--being a programmer at heart, I at the time was trying to build a gui
using c++. so I decided to use  the fltk library
the fltk library compiled on the fifth try on the linux system
I spent another three hours trying to get it to work on windows.
I first decided to use cygwin since windows doesnt support make 
after about twenty times of trying I  gave up on windows. 
I tried to use minGw for building it but gave up after another 20 or so tries.-->

I quickly learned what the underlying philosophy of linux systems
I learned that many of the were about freedom instead of forcing users to rely on a particular company they 
could develop the system their self. that programs were willing to allow users see how the underlying system worked.
