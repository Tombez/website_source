this weekend I have decided to devote my time to one of my older projects 
known as SpaceT. SpaceT is game that combines the games, space invaders and tetris together.  
The idea is that each game by itself isnt that hard or difficult but what if every time 
you made a move in one game the other game was affected.

lance and I, started the making of this game during an event called codeday.
codeday is where you spend a whole 24 hours making or programming an app
sadly we never got the game near the state we would like it to be when finished codeday.
we kept the code but for a long time, I havent had the time to focus on any of my old projects

about a week ago, lance started development of the project again. so I decided to continue the development of 
project.

the game is built on the principal that if you screw up in one part of the game the other side gets more difficult
but if you do well the game add little more diffculty but also greatly increases your ability to score points


if you would like to checkout the game and the code go to the github page at warlord500/
