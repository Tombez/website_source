[hugo] has just updated with a couple new features that I would absolutely love to include in my current website. 
the main one being the ability to compile/transpile [typescript].

<!--more-->
while right now, I don't believe the integration be good enough to convert all my mini apps on the website to typescript. 
It will definitely be a consideration later on. there are least two things I havent quite figured out before that would happen.
instead of compiling only from the assests folder compile from page bundles(aka files in the content folder). 

secondly when running from the hugo server it doesn't print typescript warnings which mostly defeats the purpose of having typescript entirely.

additionaly, hopefully those two issues will be fixed rather soon. i might change my [boggle app] to things like a score sheet getting to really 
combine both server side and client side code with hugo!!
